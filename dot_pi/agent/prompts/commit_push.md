## Context

- Current git status: `git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): `git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits for style reference: `git log --pretty=format:"%s" -20`

## Your task

Based on the above changes:

1. Create a single commit with an appropriate message (IMPORTANT: examine recent commits and follow the EXACT same style, emoji usage, capitalization, and format)
2. Push the branch to origin

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. You MUST do all of the above in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
