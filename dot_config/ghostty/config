# if Ghostty can detect it is launched from launchd (double-clicked) or
# `open`, then it defaults to `home`. On Linux with GTK, if Ghostty can detect
# it was launched from a desktop launcher, then it defaults to `home`.
#
# The value of this must be an absolute value or one of the special values
# below:
#
#   * `home` - The home directory of the executing user.
#
#   * `inherit` - The working directory of the launching process.
working-directory =

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values.
#
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`. Some notes:
#
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
#
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
#
# A keybind by default causes the input to be consumed. This means that the
# associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the running program
# in the terminal. If you wish to send the encoded value to the program,
# specify the "unconsumed:" prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
# "unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config"

# Warning: tabs do not work with a non-native fullscreen window. This

#
# Allowable values are:

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", and "tabs".
#
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
#
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
#
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).
#
# This does not work with GLFW builds.

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
#
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
#
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
# more likely to have many windows, tabs, etc. so cgroup isolation is a
# big benefit.
#
# This feature requires systemd. If systemd is unavailable, cgroup
# initialization will fail. By default, this will not prevent Ghostty
# from working (see linux-cgroup-hard-fail).
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.
#   * `always` - Always use cgroups.
#   * `single-instance` - Enable cgroups only for Ghostty instances launched
#     as single-instance applications (see gtk-single-instance).

# If this is false, then any cgroup initialization (for linux-cgroup)
# will be allowed to fail and the failure is ignored. This is useful if
# you view cgroup isolation as a "nice to have" and not a critical resource
# management feature, because Ghostty startup will not fail if cgroup APIs
# fail.
#
# If this is true, then any cgroup initialization failure will cause
# Ghostty to exit or new surfaces to not be created.

# Note: this currently only affects cgroup initialization. Subprocesses
# must always be able to move themselves into an isolated cgroup.

#
# The default value is `desktop` which will default to `true` if Ghostty
# detects it was launched from the `.desktop` file such as an app launcher.

# If `true` (default), Ghostty will enable libadwaita theme support. This

# This requires a GTK4 desktop with a GTK4 theme.
#
# If you are running GTK3 or have a GTK3 theme, you may have to set this
# to false to get your theme picked up properly. Having this set to true
