## Acknowledgements

Some [utils functions](scripts/) which I'm using for the initial [setup](run_once_install_packages.sh) and later for my update [script](private_dot_local/bin/executable_update_everything) was taken from [alrra](https://github.com/alrra)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles) repo, and I'm truly grateful for it.
